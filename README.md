# Certificate Finite State Machine

This repository contains a certificate state machine implemented in Rustlang. The state machine is designed to manage the lifecycle of certificates.

## Features

Demonstrate how statetransitions can be codified. Also add some domain spesific constraints to the FSM, like require some dates and comments to be given for appropriate transitions. Not sure if such extra constraints is a good pattern.

Illegal transitions will not compile ðŸ’¥

## Usage

DonÂ´t. Make your own.
